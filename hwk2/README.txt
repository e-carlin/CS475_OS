My program is a simple program to sort employees based
on salary. The employees are sorted in descending order
using heapsort which employs a min-heap.

To make:
$ make all

To run:
$ ./heapsort

To clean:
$ make clean


Notes:
This program was written on the provided Ubuntu image and
compiled using gcc.
