My program is a simple word analyzer. The user can enter
strings of words and the program analyzes vowel count,
consonant count, word count, and character count. The 
program only analyzes characters A-Z and a-z. Any word
containing others characters will not be counted. 

To make:
$ make all

To run:
$ ./wordstat

To clean:
$ make clean


Notes:
This program was written on the provided Ubuntu image and
compiled using gcc.
